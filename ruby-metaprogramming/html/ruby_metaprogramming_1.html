<h2>0.0 Preamble</h2>
<p>These study notes should be used along with Satoshi Asakawa's excellent course on <a href="http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/">Ruby Metaprogramming</a>. The programs in these study notes have been tested using the following Ruby version:</p>
<pre>
ruby 1.9.1p243 (2009-07-16 revision 24175) [i386-mingw32]
</pre>

<h2>1.0 Ruby Metaprogramming</h2>
<p><strong>Metaprogramming</strong> in Ruby is <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;">writing code that manipulates language constructs (like classes, modules, and instance variables) at runtime</span>. It is even possible to enter new Ruby code at runtime and execute the new code without restarting the program.</p>

<h2>1.1 Instance variables, Methods and Classes</h2>
<h3>1.1.1 An object's Instance variables / Methods</h3>
<p>Instance variables just <em>spring into existence when you use them</em>, so you can have objects of the same class that carry different sets of instance variables.</p>
<p>On the inside, an object simply contains its instance variables and a reference to its class. Thus, <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>an object's instance variables live in the object itself, and an object's methods live in the object's class (where they're called the "instance methods" of the class)</b></span>. That's why objects of the same class share methods, but they don't share instance variables.</p>

<h3>1.1.2 Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classes themselves are nothing but objects.</li>
<li>Since <span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>a class is an object</b></span>, everything that applies to objects also applies to classes. Classes, like any object, have their own class, being instances of a class called <b>Class</b>.</li>
<li>Like any object, classes also have methods. The methods of an object are also the instance methods of its class. This means that the methods of a class are the instance methods of <b>Class</b>.</li>
<li>All classes ultimately inherit from <b>Object</b>, which in turn inherits from <b>BasicObject</b>, the root of the Ruby class hierarchy.</li>
<li>Class names are nothing but constants.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.1.3 Open Classes</h3>
<p>In Ruby, <span style="color:brown;">classes are never closed</span>. You can always <a href="/satishtalim/ruby_open_classes.html">re-open existing Ruby classes</a>, even standard library classes such as <b>String</b> or <b>Array</b>, and modify them on the fly.</p>
<pre>
class String
  def writesize
    self.size
  end
end
puts "Tell me my size!".writesize
</pre>
<p><b>Warning</b>: Be careful with Open Classes, if you casually add bits and pieces of functionality to classes, you can end up with bugs like, for example, defining your own <b>capitalize( )</b> method and inadvertently overwriting the original <b>capitalize( )</b> method in the class <b>String</b>.</p>

<h3>1.1.4 Multiple initialize methods?</h3>
<p>Following is an example of class overloading. We write a Rectangle class that represents a rectangular shape on a grid. You can instantiate a Rectangle by one of two ways: by passing in the coordinates of its top-left and bottom-right corners, or by passing in its top-left corner along with its length and width. In Ruby there is only one <b>initialize</b> method, but in this example you can act as though there were two.</p>
<pre>
# The Rectangle constructor accepts arguments in either
# of the following forms:
#   Rectangle.new([x_top, y_left], length, width)
#   Rectangle.new([x_top, y_left], [x_bottom, y_right])
class Rectangle
  def initialize(*args)
    if args.size &lt; 2  || args.size &gt; 3
      puts 'Sorry. This method takes either 2 or 3 arguments.'
    else
      puts 'Correct number of arguments.'
    end
  end
end
Rectangle.new([10, 23], 4, 10)
Rectangle.new([10, 23], [14, 13])
</pre>
<p>The above program is incomplete from the Rectangle class viewpoint, but is enough to demonstrate how method overloading can be achieved. Overloading allows that the <b>initialize</b> method takes in a variable number of arguments. This works for any method, it doesn't have to be the <b>initialize</b> method only.</p>

<h3>1.1.5 Anonymous class</h3>
<p><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;">An anonymous class is also known as a singleton class, eigenclass, ghost class, metaclass or an uniclass</span>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC;"><b>Each object in Ruby has its own anonymous class, a class that can have methods, but is only attached to the object itself</b></span>: When <em>we add a method to a specific object</em>, Ruby inserts a new, anonymous class into the inheritance hierarchy as a container to hold these types of methods. What's important to understand is that the anonymous class is a regular class which is <em>hidden</em>. It has no name and is not accessible through a constant like other classes. You can't instantiate a new object from it.</p>
<p>Here are some ways by which you can define an anonymous class:</p>

<pre>
# 1
class Rubyist
  def self.who
    "Geek"
  end
end

# 2
class Rubyist
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def who
      "Geek"
    end
  end
end

# 3
class Rubyist
end
def Rubyist.who
  "Geek"
end

#4
class Rubyist
end
Rubyist.instance_eval do
  def who
    "Geek"
  end
end
puts Rubyist.who # => Geek

# 5
class &lt;&lt; Rubyist
  def who
    "Geek"
  end
end
</pre>
<p>All five snippets above, define a <b>Rubyist.who</b> that returns <b>Geek</b>.</p>
<p>Anytime one sees a strange looking class definition (# 5 above) where the <b>class</b> keyword is followed by "&lt;&lt;" symbols, you can be sure that an anonymous class is being opened for the object to the right of those symbols.</p>

<p>The following class hierarchy (courtesy: <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/08/understanding-the-ruby-object-model/">Nick Morgan</a>) is informative:</p>
