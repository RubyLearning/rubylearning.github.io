            <p>Today I&rsquo;d like to try something a little different on the blog and open
up a topic for some discussion. This one could cause some ‘energetic’
conversation but I’d love to do an informal poll on it anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Top 3 Most Useful Ruby Gems – and why?</strong></p>

<p>I’d love to hear your opinion and some of the reasoning for your choice.</p>

<p>There’s no right or wrong ultimately (although I know some readers hold
strong opinions on the matter) – but hopefully in the discussion and
reasons for your answer we’ll have some good learning.</p>

<p>Post your comments and go into the draw to win \$25 worth of screencasts
(Episode 1 to 5) from <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dtrubyom/the-ruby-object-model-and-metaprogramming">The Pragmatic
Bookshelf</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: I’ll kick things off – I asked some Rubyists on their choice of
the “<strong>Top 3 Most Useful Gems</strong>” and here is what they said:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/11/25/little-known-ways-to-ruby-mastery-by-bruce-tate/">Bruce
Tate</a></strong>
–

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://mongoid.org/">Mongoid</a></strong>: The nosql movement is in
full swing, and mongoid is our mapper of choice. The criteria
API is excellent, start-up is easy and efficient, and you can
peel away the API to get straight to the MongoDB API beneath.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">Shoulda</a></strong>: I know this
gem is going to be taking a back seat to rspec, but we love it.
The matchers are brilliant, but I really love the lack of
ceremony in this gem set. We maintain full testing coverage, and
shoulda makes it easy.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 3</a></strong>: I need to tip my hat to
the team. They’ve done a great job simplifying routing, active
record, and opening up the architecture at the same time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/chaupt">Christopher Haupt</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://nokogiri.org/">nokogiri</a></strong>: We do a lot of HTML and
XML parsing/digesting for our app. Having tried many other tools
for the job over time, I keep finding nokogiri gets the job done
with simplicity, speed, and stability.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml</a></strong>: It is actually painful for me
to use ERB now that all of my projects use haml. The number of
programming mistakes due to typos is much lower. Amazing what a
little forced indentation can do.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://redcareditor.com/">redcar</a></strong>: This may be cheating a
bit, but it is delivered as a gem! I constantly get asked about
tools for Ruby development, and choice of editor can be
something of a religious choice. I use TextMate, vim,
e-TextEditor, and occasionally RubyMine. Redcar holds a lot of
promise, is very hackable, and is open source!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://rufy.com/">Lucas Carlson</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://andand.rubyforge.org/">andand</a></strong>: Nil error bugs are
among the most common kind you encounter with imperative
languages and the <code>andand</code> library bridges the gap in and easy
and straightforward way. Not as good as functional programming,
but a good compromise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/aasm">aasm</a></strong>: State machines are a
great way to deal with highly state-full interactions. Keeping
track of whether an email account has been validated or if a
blog post is published or drafted are great examples of ways
that state machines can make your life easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://thoughtbot.com/community/">paperclip</a></strong>: Such an
elegant solution to storing uploaded files with various backend
data storage methods, this gem is one of the true gems of using
Ruby.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://paulbarry.com/">Paul Barry</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a></strong>: It has picked up the torch
from Hpricot as the best way to parse HTML/XML. Nokogiri makes
pulling data off the web so easy that powerful, useful programs
can be written in just a few lines of code.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a></strong>: Having a queue
that can be used to process background jobs is essential for any
web application. Resque uses
<a href="http://github.com/antirez/redis">Redis</a> to make that easy and
provides a useful web interface to check in on your background
jobs and see what’s going on.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a></strong>: Cucumber has completely
changed the way I test applications by providing a way to write
clear high-level tests that everyone involved in the project can
understand. Having re-usable step definitions makes it fast and
easy to write maintainable tests that only need to change when
the business logic changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.funonrails.com/">Sandip Ransing</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 3</a></strong>: ROR is an open-source
web framework which follows the MVC pattern and agile
methodologies built over Ruby language. I am working with Rails
for the past 3 years and have built many Rails applications in a
very short period. Many thanks to David (creator of Rails) and
the Rails team for their awesome work. The open-source community
is playing a fantastic role in adding new features to Rails and
by contributing through gems and plugins. Recently Rails 3 has
released many more features. Let’s ride Rails 3 and definitely
it would me more fun
<img src="http://rubylearning.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://freelancing-god.github.com/ts/en/">Thinking Sphinx</a></strong>:
(Lines copied as it is from the sphinx site) Sphinx is a very
fast search engine that indexes data and provides flexible ways
of searching it. Thinking Sphinx allows you to link up your
models into Sphinx simply and painlessly -– because let’s face
it, searching across multiple fields using SQL is a pain in the
neck. There are other search options which we have used earlier
before migrating to sphinx, such as <strong>acts_as_ferret</strong> (Lack
of proper documentation and takes time to index, therefore
performance wise not effective) and <strong>acts_as_solr</strong> (requires
Java as an overhead. Good to use with JRuby, though). Sphinx
(high performance, tons of records can be indexed within
minutes, easy to use because of proper documentation).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/sandal/prawn">Prawn</a></strong>: PDF Library built
over Ruby language to simplify pdf generation. Easy to use,
neat, proper documentation, predefined layouts, faster,
continuous development and support makes prawn the best among
other pdf libraries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/sebgrosjean">Sébastien Grosjean</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/devise">devise</a></strong>: An highly
flexible Authentication management. Baked with full features as
an engine, it’s really quick to get started with default views,
… but also really easy to update to your desired need and style.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wiki">will_paginate</a></strong>:
Does an introduction is still needed? Simply the best solution
I’ve found to handle any model pagination.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/svenfuchs/routing-filter">routing_filter</a></strong>:
Working mainly in Europe, I have extensive needs to develop
multilingual applications. On my side, routing_filter helps me
handle locales in URL and URL helpers. It gives a great
flexibility, and allow you much more than that, can be really
helpful for clean paginated URLs, showing extensions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://joshsoftware.com/">Sethupathi Asokan</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://josh-splat.heroku.com/#1">Josh-splat</a></strong>: Ruby gem is
initiated and developed by Josh Software for SMS platform. It
acts as a platform for different SMS service providers so that
the user/developers don’t need to worry about different type of
formats. In the recently concluded LSRC 2010 our <a href="http://twitter.com/gautamrege">Gautam
Rege</a> presented and got a
wonderful response.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails 3</a></strong>: Josh Software is
exclusive into RoR development and Rails 3 is a breeze for any
web base application. It is evolving and widely accepted by
everyone. There are growing number of hosting companies
supporting Rails 3.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">delayed_job</a></strong>:
One of the best worker thread we have worked on. It eases the
developer’s work by providing various useful options (main one
is retry).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://vgoff.posterous.com/">Victor H. Goff III</a></strong> –

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a></strong>: for allowing me to
test various versions of Ruby, and for the gemsets that let you
keep your development and application environment clean. For
BSD/Linux based systems.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler">bundler</a></strong>: for allowing
you to ‘package’ your dependencies easily.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/pik">pik</a></strong>: for multiple Ruby
versions for Windows users.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
