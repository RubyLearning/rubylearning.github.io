 If
you have worked with web applications in Ruby in the past few years, you
might have heard of a web-based interface library called
<a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t, you might want to
look under the hoods of your web framework, you&rsquo;ll likely find it
nestled comfortably somewhere inside its core. The premise of Rack is
simple &ndash; it just allows you to easily deal with HTTP requests.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">HTTP</a> is a simple
protocol; it just basically describes the activity of a client sending a
HTTP request to a server and the server returning a HTTP response. Both
HTTP request and response in turn have very similar structures. A HTTP
request is a triplet consisting of a method and resource pair, a set of
headers and an optional body while a HTTP response is triplet consisting
of a response code, a set of headers and an optional body.</p>

<p>Rack maps closely to this. A Rack application is a Ruby object that has
a <code>call</code> method, which has a single argument, the environment,
(corresponding to a HTTP request) and returns an array of 3 elements,
status, headers and body (corresponding to a HTTP response). This simple
definition allows it to be used as a foundational interface for building
more sophisticated web frameworks such as <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on
Rails</a>, <a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> and
<a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>.</p>

<p>Besides being the basic building block for most Ruby web frameworks,
Rack enables a very interesting feature, somewhat appropriately called
&lsquo;middleware&rsquo;. The fundamental idea behind Rack middleware is come
between the calling client and the server, processing the HTTP request
before sending it to the server, and processing the HTTP response before
returning it to the client.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-diagram1.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>What makes this idea especially interesting and useful is that
middleware can be stacked on top of each other! Coupled with the fact
that many of the Ruby web frameworks out there are built on top of Rack
and therefore any applications built with those frameworks can be Rack
middleware, we can build really modular applications with a number of
combinations!</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-diagram2.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>So how is this useful? One very practical example is developing large
web applications in distributed teams. We can break down the application
into sets of features, each implemented in a different piece of
middleware, each with its own set of models, views and controllers.
Integration is then just taking each piece of the middleware and
stacking them up in the main server, which can be a very basic web
application (and in fact, is another piece of middleware!).</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to show a very simple example of how this can be
done. I will be using Sinatra for both the middleware as well as the
server. All the code in this example is in
<a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular">http://github.com/sausheong/modular</a>.
Note that this sample is very Sinatra specific &ndash; each Rack-based web
framework would likely to have some variance in the way this is
implemented. Let&rsquo;s look at a use case first.</p>

<p>You are a project manager for a new project and you have been given the
unenviable task of delivering a project with a tight deadline. In order
to help you with this, your management has given you a sizable team to
do the job. That&rsquo;s the good news. The bad news is that the people in the
project team are distributed around the world (since they are formed
from various existing teams). The best way to do this, you decided, is
to split up project by modular, independent features and get the various
team members to deliver them in parallel. You also decided that you
needed a core few team members to build the common functions and the
platform upon which the other team members build their modules on. The
architecture looks something like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-diagram3.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the implementation of the application. First, we have a
base server application, which is written by the platform team. The base
server application provides the framework for the rest of the modules to
sit on. It should provide a number of fundamental services, but in this
example, I will only show simple user authentication and a set of common
helper functions.</p>

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
%w(haml sinatra rack-flash json rest_client active_support).each  { |gem| require gem}
%w(user).each {|model| require model}
%w(sinatra/common_helper middleware).each {|feature| require feature}

set :sessions, true
set :show_exceptions, false
use Rack::Flash
use Middleware::App

get '/' do
  redirect '/dashboard' if session[:id]  
  redirect '/login'
end

get '/login' do haml :login, :layout =&gt; false end

post '/login' do  
  if authenticate(params[:email], params[:password])
    redirect '/'
  else
    redirect_with_message '/login', 'Email or password wrong. Please try again'
  end
end

get '/logout' do
  session.clear
  redirect '/'
end

get '/dashboard' do
  require_login
  haml :dashboard
end


error do  redirect '/' end
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular/blob/master/server/server.rb">Source</a></p>

<p>In the <code>server</code> folder of repository, you will find a normal Sinatra
application. In fact this forms a skeletal frame of a very simple web
application with user authentication capabilities. Let&rsquo;s look at some of
the code.</p>

<pre><code>%w(user).each {|model| require model}
</code></pre>

<p>This requires the user model, defined in
<a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a>. You will not find it in the
<code>server</code> folder because it is in a separate folder named
<code>server-models</code>. If you look into the <code>server-models</code> folder you will
find that it is set up to be packaged as a gem. Why is this so? This is
because the user data model is a part of the base platform, used in most
parts of the application, including most if not all other modules. In
order to allow other team members to have access to the user data model,
we package it as a gem and deliver it through a private gem server (more
about this later). For now, just notice that we deploy the user data
model as a gem, and require it in the server application.</p>

<pre><code>%w(sinatra/common_helper middleware).each {|feature| require feature}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we require two other packages. If you look at the other top-level
folders in the source code, you&rsquo;ll realize that both these packages are
also gems, and as you would have guessed it, they are delivered to the
server through a private gem server and required in the server
application as well.</p>

<p>The <code>CommonHelper</code> package is as its name implies, a set of commonly
used Sinatra helpers. In the Sinatra documentation, they are known as
Sinatra Extensions.</p>

<p>The <code>Middleware</code> package is the Rack middleware package we will inspect
in depth in a while, also packaged as a gem. Note that requiring it is
not enough, in a couple of lines further down, you need to use it as
well.</p>

<pre><code>use Middleware::App
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the code is relatively simple so I&rsquo;ll skip it.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the user data model next. Again, this is rather
straightforward DataMapper code, nothing fanciful.</p>

<pre><code>require 'dm-core'
require 'dm-migrations'

DataMapper.setup(:default, 'mysql://root:root@localhost/modular')

class User
  include DataMapper::Resource

  property :id, Serial
  property :name, String
  property :email, String
end
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular/blob/master/server-models/lib/user.rb">Source</a></p>

<p>You might notice that this and all other packages are distributed as
gems. This is really for the convenience of distributing changes to the
rest of the team. Essentially, whatever changes you make to your own
packages, you simply push a new version of the gem to the private gem
server and let the rest of the team know. For the rest of the team, this
works well because they can choose to use the latest version or use a
prior version in case the latest doesn&rsquo;t work properly.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the common helper.</p>

<pre><code>require 'sinatra/base'

module Sinatra
  module CommonHelper

    def require_login
      redirect_with_message('/login', 'Please login first') unless session[:id]
    end

    def authenticate(email, password)
      response = RestClient.post('https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin', 
      'accountType' =&gt; 'HOSTED_OR_GOOGLE', 
      'Email'  =&gt; email, 
      'Passwd' =&gt; password, 
      :service =&gt; 'xapi', 
      :source  =&gt; 'Goog-Auth-1.0') do |response, request, result, &amp;block|

        user = User.first :email =&gt; email
        if response.code == 200 and not user.nil?
          session[:id] = response.to_s   
          session[:user] = user.id.to_s
          return true        
        end
        return false
      end
    end

    def redirect_with_message(to_location, message)
      flash[:message] = message
      redirect to_location
    end

  end
  helpers CommonHelper
end
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular/blob/master/common_helper/lib/sinatra/common_helper.rb">Source</a></p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this is actually a Sinatra extension, packaged
in a gem. Note that we require <code>sinatra/base</code> instead of <code>sinatra</code> here.
In this example, I used Google&rsquo;s
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForInstalledApps.html">ClientLogin</a>
as the authentication mechanism, because of the relative ease of using
it. Under actual production conditions, you will want to use something
like <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> instead.</p>

<p>Notice this line near the bottom of the code:</p>

<pre><code>helpers CommonHelper
</code></pre>

<p>This essentially registers these helpers in whichever Sinatra
application or middleware that is requiring in this module.</p>

<p>Until now, we&rsquo;ve been only dealing with code that is written by the
platform team members. These are the packages that will be used by other
module team members and they are distributed as gems through a private
gem server. Now let&rsquo;s look at the code the module teams will be
developing.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the data model used in a module. This is found in the
middleware-models folder of the sample code.</p>

<pre><code>require 'dm-core'
require 'dm-migrations'
require 'user'

DataMapper.setup(:default, 'mysql://root:root@localhost/modular')

class Order
  include DataMapper::Resource

  property :id, Serial
  property :created_on, DateTime
  property :order_no, String

  belongs_to :user  
end
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular/blob/master/middleware-models/lib/order.rb">Source</a></p>

<p>As in the user data model, this is simply DataMapper stuff. Take note
though that we refer to the user model here.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the middleware itself.</p>

<pre><code>require 'sinatra/base'
require 'haml'
require 'order'
require 'sinatra/common_helper'

module Middleware
  class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
    helpers Sinatra::CommonHelper

    configure do
      set :public, File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'public')
      set :views, File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'views') 
      set :server_layout, File.read(File.join(File.dirname(File.expand_path($0)), 'views/layout.haml'))           
    end

    get '/orders' do
      require_login
      @orders = Order.all      
      haml :list, :layout =&gt; settings.server_layout
    end 

    get '/orders/:id' do
      @order = Order.get params[:id]
      haml :show, :layout =&gt; settings.server_layout
    end

  end
end
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular/blob/master/middleware/lib/middleware.rb">Source</a></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go into details in this code. Firstly, note that this is
implemented as a Sinatra application in the non-classic way, that is, we
sub-classed <code>Sinatra::Base</code>. This is because the classic style pollutes
the namespace and assumes a single view and public folder, making it
difficult to stack multiple Sinatra applications like we want to.</p>

<p>Next, because we sub-class <code>Sinatra::Base</code>, we need to explicitly
register <code>CommonHelper</code> as a helper. Notice that because <code>CommonHelper</code>
is a Sinatra extension, we can use it in the server as well as in any of
the middleware.</p>

<p>Next, we set some configurations.</p>

<pre><code>set :public, File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'public')
set :views, File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'views')
</code></pre>

<p>The two settings for public and view folders are necessary because
otherwise, we&rsquo;ll fall back on the server&rsquo;s public and view folders,
which mean we will not have the clean separation we want. Remember that
each module is supposed to be independent and self-contained &ndash; we want
to encapsulate all views and other assets used only in this module.</p>

<pre><code>set :server_layout, File.read(File.join(File.dirname(File.expand_path($0)), 'views/layout.haml'))
</code></pre>

<p>The next setting is interesting because while we want the modules to be
independent, we don&rsquo;t want to copy the layout view into every piece of
middleware we create, and update them every time something changes at
the server. This configuration essentially searches for the layout file
in the server (here I&rsquo;m assuming the view folder is named <code>view</code> and
we&rsquo;re using <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a>) and loads it up in the
middleware. This layout (in Haml) will be used when we specify which
layout to use in the routes.</p>

<pre><code>haml :list, :layout =&gt; settings.server_layout
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>view</code> folder is bundled together as part of the gem. This
is what we want, because we want this team to be wholly responsible for
the feature.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through the code quickly; now let&rsquo;s see how it is used. I
will talk about how we can deploy this step by step.</p>

<p>First, we need to create the models. In the screenshots below, I built
the gems using the user and order data models. Firstly, you need to
<a href="http://github.com/sausheong/modular">download the code from Github</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-04.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-05.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>After creating the models, I go into irb and use DataMapper to migrate
them (this assumes I have already created a MySQL database with the name
<code>modular</code>). I need to create a user as well. This is only really
applicable for the authentication and it can be any Gmail account (since
I&rsquo;m using Google ClientLogin).</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-06.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>As with the data models, I need to package the common helpers and the
middleware into gems as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-07.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-08.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s done! Now, run the server application and then fire up a
browser to view your new modular application.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-09.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-10.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>Notice here that the layout for the orders page is from the server,
since the middleware does not provide any layouts. You can, of course,
set layouts for every piece of middleware though most applications would
want to keep a consistent user experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rack-sample-11.png" alt="rack" />
</p>

<p>Building web applications used to be done in smaller and geographically
closer teams. Now that web applications are the mainstream, and globally
distributed development teams are common, it&rsquo;s important to be able to
organize the development in a more modular and effective way. If you&rsquo;re
using Ruby in any web application development, I would encourage you to
try out Rack to make it more modular!</p>
