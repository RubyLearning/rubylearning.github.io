<h2 id="about-john-trupiano:bc855198dcf4b729ddfc67d8115b407c">About John Trupiano</h2>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/johntrupiano.jpg" alt="John
Trupiano" title="John Trupiano" />
John
Trupiano (<a href="http://twitter.com/jtrupiano">twitter</a>) is the co-founder of
<a href="http://smartlogicsolutions.com/">SmartLogic</a>, the premiere Ruby
development team in Baltimore, Maryland. He is an active member in the
technology and business communities in the mid-Atlantic region. He is
highly involved with the local Ruby user group (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/">Bmore on
Rails</a>) and recently organized
the first ever <a href="http://mdtechcrawl.com/">Maryland TechCrawl</a>, a show and
tell event showcasing the exciting and innovative technologies being
developed in the region. He is also very active in the open source
community having authored <a href="http://github.com/jtrupiano/timecop">timecop</a>
and <a href="http://github.com/jtrupiano/rack-rewrite">Rack::Rewrite</a> and
contributing to a slew of projects including rails, capistrano, shoulda,
factory_girl, gemcutter and multitest.</p>

<p>John has this to say about the challenge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I think the Ruby challenge is great because it instills from the very
start the idea that you need to practice to become a great programmer.
Even as a problem setter, I have found the exercise of defining a
problem and iterating through various solutions to be extremely
educational and beneficial. Satish has cultivated a fantastic program
here that provides access for beginners to seasoned Ruby programmers.
Furthermore, the Ruby challenge serves as a notice to the Ruby
community that it is important for us to provide a welcoming and
nurturing environment for newcomers.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-ruby-challenge:bc855198dcf4b729ddfc67d8115b407c"><strong>The Ruby Challenge</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/rubypc.jpg" alt="RPCFN" title="Ruby Programming Challenge For Newbies" />
</p>

<h3 id="the-challenge:bc855198dcf4b729ddfc67d8115b407c">The Challenge</h3>

<p>Imagine that you manage a t-shirt printing company. Each morning you
review all orders placed the prior day and determine how long each order
will take to fulfill. On any given day, only a certain number of your
printing machines are operational. Your job is to schedule each printing
job with one of the operational printing machines in such a manner that
(a) all t-shirts are printed in the least amount of time, and (b) the
distribution of work across machines is as fair as possible (i.e. the
standard deviation of the time each machine spends working is
minimized).</p>

<p>Your objective is to write a <strong>FairDistribution</strong> class that satisfies
the following test cases. The code in the test cases is sufficient to
define the methods you must implement.</p>

<p>This is an NP complete problem, and as such I have only provided very
small datasets in the test cases. Test case #3 takes the longest to
solve (See **Notes below about how to run the Test Case #3) and you
may find it easier to comment it out early in your development phase. On
a MBP Pro with a 2.4 GHz dual core processor and 4GB RAM, it took just
over 3 minutes to solve. The other three test cases took only a couple
of seconds.</p>

<p>Note that test cases 2 and 4 define specific distributions against which
you can verify. Test cases 1 and 3 have more than one acceptable
distribution and as such I have not provided a specific distribution to
test against.</p>

<p>Note also that there is a well known algorithm that provides a much
faster though not optimal solution. It will pass all tests except for
test case #3. If you are only able to determine this particular
solution, please still consider submitting your solution for
consideration.</p>

<p><strong>** Notes</strong>: To accommodate the fact that Test Case #3 takes a long
time to run, you can run the test normally, and TC#3 will not run. When
you want the TC#3 to run, then you can run the following:</p>

<pre><code>ruby test_solution_acceptance.rb full
</code></pre>

<p>The word “full” will signal it to run all the test cases.</p>

<h3 id="the-test-suite:bc855198dcf4b729ddfc67d8115b407c">The Test Suite</h3>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/286495">test_solution_acceptance.rb</a></p>

<h3 id="requirements:bc855198dcf4b729ddfc67d8115b407c">Requirements</h3>

<p>The solution to the challenge has to be a pure Ruby script, using only
the Ruby Standard Libraries (meaning, no external Gems). You <strong>do not</strong>
need to build a gem for this. Pure Ruby code is all that is needed.</p>
