      <title>Rails Summit Latin America 2009</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/09/26/rails-summit-latin-america-2009/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/09/26/rails-summit-latin-america-2009/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.railssummit.com.br/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/rails_summit_2009.png&#34; alt=&#34;Rails Summit Latin America
2009&#34; title=&#34;Rails Summit Latin America 2009&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2005 there was virtually no Ruby community in Brazil. David
Hansson himself was there, at the FISL conference, showcasing a pre-1.0
Rails (which later became the famous 15-min blog screencast). Only 3
years later the community grew up dramatically and in 2008, Rails
Summit Latin America was unleashed and it was a huge success. They had more
than 20 international speakers, more than 550 attendees in 2 full days with 2
parallel tracks, real-time translators, coffee-break, lunch, ubiquitous wi-fi,
and much more. They targetted a RailsConf-like event and I think they
delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/MarcosFabioWillian.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marcos, Fabio and Willian at the Rails Summit Latin America
2008&#34; title=&#34;Marcos, Fabio and Willian at the Rails Summit Latin America 2008&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year they want to repeat the success with the 2nd edition of the
Summit. It’s going to happen at the same place, in Sao Paulo City,
Brazil. They expect to see people through out South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attend to celebrate Rails, get to know other Railers, increase your
business network and, of course, learn even more about Ruby and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RubyLearning&#39;s Sponsor: ProjectLocker</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/24/rubylearnings-sponsor-projectlocker/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/24/rubylearnings-sponsor-projectlocker/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor –
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.projectlocker.com/&#34;&gt;ProjectLocker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.projectlocker.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/ProjectLocker125x125.gif&#34; alt=&#34;ProjectLocker: Software Quality on
Demand&#34; title=&#34;ProjectLocker: Software Quality on Demand&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProjectLocker provides tools and services to help software development
teams quickly set up an enterprise-quality infrastructure at an
affordable price. Using ProjectLocker, teams can spend less time
finding, configuring, and managing tools and more time doing what is
most important â€” writing great software to meet customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProjectLocker’s suite of software development tools features source
control with both Git &amp;amp; Subversion hosting, and bug tracking, wiki, and
project management with hosted Trac. These solutions are available
almost immediately after signing up online and come in an array of
subscription packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProjectLocker Free&lt;/em&gt; â€“ an ad-supported option that offers up to
300MB of space for 2 users that’s available at no cost to the
clients, who can then earn more space &amp;amp; users through invitations
and referrals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProjectLocker Lite â€“ the basic paid service with multiple levels
(Seed, Angel, Venture, and Equity) tailored to the growth stages of
a software company that allows clients to gracefully expand as
needed, starting at \$2.50 per month for 1GB of storage space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ProjectLocker Enterprise â€“ for full scale IT departments seeking
to lower the total cost of ownership of their development
infrastructure, where clients have no preset data limits and can
purchase both ProjectLocker’s standard Trac &amp;amp; SCM offerings as well
as a number of proprietary productivity tools on an a la carte
basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ProjectLocker integrates with many of the most popular and
successful development tools in the cloud, including Basecamp, Rally,
FogBugz, Twitter, Jabber, and Mor.ph. These features, along with the
availability of unlimited projects and repositories for all service
levels, lets ProjectLocker provide everything teams need to communicate
with each other and with their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProjectLocker: Software Quality on Demand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProjectLocker has a record of customer service and reliability that is
unmatched in the hosted tools space. ProjectLocker provides both e-mail
and telephone technical support to its clients. It also performs hourly
backups of all client data that can be used to implement up to bare
metal restores if necessary and has maintained 99.9% uptime for its
hosted servers since 2003. ProjectLocker’s web-based delivery model
allows teams to access their tools securely anywhere they can access the
Internet â€” even through most client firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, contact ProjectLocker by calling +1-866-GO-GET-PL
(+1-866-464-3875), e-mailing sales (at) projectlocker.com, or by

      <title>RubyLearning&#39;s Sponsor: Railsware</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/22/rubylearnings-sponsor-railsware/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/22/rubylearnings-sponsor-railsware/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor –
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.railsware.com/&#34;&gt;Railsware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.railsware.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/Railsware125x125.png&#34; alt=&#34;Railsware for premium-quality web
applications&#34; title=&#34;Railsware for premium-quality web applications&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter, twitter! Are you twittering all around and nobody hears your
sweet voice? That’s strange. Perhaps Twitter isn’t your marketing tool.
However for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.railsware.com/&#34;&gt;Railsware&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter became that
real call to action when the team of Ruby on Rails developers preaching
methods of agile programming came together in 2005. Until that time
Twitter had not become so ‘rich and famous’ as it is now, developers
were open to new ideas and the goal was somewhere far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its very first project, Railsware got focused on fast
implementation of web applications using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.railsware.com/be-agile&#34;&gt;agile
methods&lt;/a&gt;. As another example,
37signals became one of those companies who succeeded in elegant and
powerful Rails development. Their book &amp;ldquo;Getting Real&amp;rdquo;? became a
universal guide for &lt;a href=&#34;http://railsware.com/services&#34;&gt;Railsware&lt;/a&gt; to
building successful web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Railsware for premium-quality web applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source Rails community gives developers an opportunity to discover
new methods and tools, to meet requirements not met by the licensed
software. Twitter is the same. Even today Twitter is probably the
biggest Rails site on the web and its growing scalability is a loud fact
of its open-source nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that Email, IM, RSS, SMS and the web are just transports
as well as Twitter? Railsware gives every startup-idea a fast scalable
‘ware’ delivering solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RubyLearning&#39;s Sponsor: Blue Box Group</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/10/rubylearnings-sponsor-blue-box-group/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor – &lt;a href=&#34;https://boxpanel.blueboxgrp.com/public/order/partner/43921&#34;&gt;Blue Box
Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is shaping up to be another big one for Blue Box Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://boxpanel.blueboxgrp.com/public/order/partner/43921&#34;&gt;Blue Box
Group&lt;/a&gt; has
got some great new features for release, upgrades to their service
offerings, appearances at various events and conferences and more. Check
out their site and subscribe to their
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blueboxgrp.com/news&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest updates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-releases-and-future-plans:168488ba44e8356aa3c5c9e651ad5fea&#34;&gt;New Releases and Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Box Group has recently added and updated many of their Box Panel
control panel features. One of their personal favorites is the private
customer chat that they have added. Now once a customer is logged into
their Box Panel account, they are able to start a private chat session
with one of their support representatives. If youâ€™ve ever got a quick
question that you want to have answered or your siteâ€™s having a
problem, you can now privately chat with a support representative who
will help you get your problems solved. And itâ€™s all encrypted from
end to endâ€” so you can be sure that only you and Blue Box Group are
privy to your conversation. Cool beans, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature they have released in the past two weeks is their
Bundled Content Delivery Network. Now customers of Blue Box Group are
able to guarantee their siteâ€™s availability and speed by hosting their
static content on their CDN. With 24 points of presence around the
globe, no matter where your visitors come from, theyâ€™ll see faster
load times and a more reliable application. Find out more about the CDN
now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability and performance are two of the main problems Rails
developers face when developing sites. Blue Box Group has recently
partnered with New Relic RPM to provide support and integration of the
RPM into Box Panel. All customerâ€™s of Blue Box Group can sign-up for
RPM Lite free of charge directly from their Box Panel account. Once
signed up, RPM stats are viewable directly from Box Panel. Now
developers can get great insight into the inner workings of their
applications straight from Blue Box Group. Read their blog entry on this
partnership to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have also got some great things planned for 2009. Their Box Panel
user interface is going to redesigned from the ground up with
user-friendliness in mind. They are also planning a new feature to Box
Panel allowing customers to clone and deploy VPS images on demand. Need
a cluster? Once this feature goes live, youâ€™ll be able to deploy one
yourself in just a few minutes. These are just a few of the updates and
features they have got planned for 2009. So subscribe to their blog to
receive announcements about their latest updates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://boxpanel.blueboxgrp.com/public/order/partner/43921&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/bbg.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Blue Box
Group&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sponsorships-and-events:168488ba44e8356aa3c5c9e651ad5fea&#34;&gt;Sponsorships and Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Box Group is dedicated to advancing the Ruby and Rails communities.
Companies and organizations which they feel are beneficial to their
customers and the general Rails communities stand-out to them from time
to time. When a company shines like this, they like to show their
support by sponsoring their project. Here are some companies and
projects they have found over the past year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://iphoneonrails.com/&#34;&gt;iPhone on Rails&lt;/a&gt;: The iPhone has quickly
rocketed to the forefront of mobile technology. Ever wanted to tap
into this base of millions of users worldwide using Rails
technology? Thanks to iPhone on Railsâ€™ Objective Resource, now you
can! ObjectiveResource is a framework for the iPhone that makes
interacting with Ruby on Rails applications dead simple. Find out
more from iPhone on Rails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rubylearning.org/&#34;&gt;RubyLearning&lt;/a&gt; â€“ The Blue Box Group
loves Ruby on Rails! Satish Talimâ€™s wonderful web-site
RubyLearning.org helps to spread the joys of Ruby across the web.
Offering classes on a multitude of topics relating to Ruby and the
Rails community, this site is a great place to brush up on your Ruby
skills. You should stop by today!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.npost.com/&#34;&gt;nPost&lt;/a&gt; â€“ Seattle is a birthing ground for
great technology start-ups. nPost realizes this and has built a
wonderful community for start-ups anywhere. In addition to their
website, blog and newsletter, nPost holds events and get-togethers
for entrepreneurs, angel investors and venture capitalists in the
Seattle area. Blue Box Group is proud to sponsor this wonderful
place for technology innovation. Head over to the nPost site and
check them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Box Group will also be attending RailsConf 2009 in Las Vegas, NV.
Ruby and Rails experts from around the globe attend this conference to
hear about the latest trends and technologies in the Rails community.
They will be there as an exhibitor, so be sure to look for their booth
in the exhibition hall. The conference runs from May 4th â€“ 7th and
tickets are going fast. To find out more or to register, head over to
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.railsconf.com/&#34;&gt;RailsConf09&lt;/a&gt; site now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RubyLearning&#39;s Sponsor: Rails Kits</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/10/rubylearnings-sponsor-rails-kits/</link>

      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/03/10/rubylearnings-sponsor-rails-kits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s sponsor – &lt;a href=&#34;http://railskits.com/&#34;&gt;Rails
Kits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails Kits is the place to get ready-to-use Rails code that will help
you build your apps faster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails Kits provides Rails developers with ready-made and well-tested
code for getting projects off to a quick start. Developers can save
time, skipping the boring stuff like writing recurring billing code, and
dive straight in to the fun stuff. Use the Rails Kits to get your
project done in less time and with less work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2009, &lt;a href=&#34;http://railskits.com/&#34;&gt;Rails Kits&lt;/a&gt; will celebrate its
first anniversary of launching the first Kit, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://railskits.com/saas/&#34;&gt;SaaS Rails
Kit&lt;/a&gt;. The reception to the SaaS Rails Kit
has been overwhelmingly positive, with great apps like Sifter, Let’s
Freckle, and Expens’d using it. In that year a number of other Kits have
been released, the latest being the Helpdesk Rails Kit. This Kit makes
it easy to add a support section and a knowledge base to your Rails app
(or even as just a standalone site), and it integrates very well with
email to make it a great way to easily provide support for customers
from an individual or a team of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year Rails Kits is looking forward to releasing more Rails Kits
(and they are always open to suggestions from anyone on what would make
a great next Kit to launch). Rails Kits is also eagerly looking forward
to Rails 2.3 with its enhanced Engines support, which will allow them to
make the Kits even easier to integrate into existing Rails projects and
use multiple Kits together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://railskits.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/railskits_logo_125x125.gif&#34; alt=&#34;RailsKits&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people at Rails Kits are also looking forward to seeing the Rails
Kits community grow, meeting new people, and seeing awesome new apps get
built using the tools they provide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time to thank RubyLearning’s excellent sponsor –
Locaweb.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:913e1cdf8a9373b02242ebb6ce42b952:fn-1536-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:913e1cdf8a9373b02242ebb6ce42b952:fn-1536-1&#34;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locaweb is Growing real Fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/&#34;&gt;Locaweb&lt;/a&gt; has just made a big announcement
this week. All web shared hosting plans now offer *unlimited* disk
storage and bandwidth! It may not sound as big as it is if you’re from
the US, for instance, but it is a pretty big deal if you’re from Latin
America. There has been small attempts before by others but this is the
move of the largest web hosting company in Brazil, which changes the
rules of the game. They have also changed their website, with brand new,
more modern layout and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also been rolling out “Mobimail” the brand new e-mail solution
that’s been offered to all new clients. This new system allows for
better mobility options such as synchronization with smartphones such as
the iPhone through ActiveSync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/locaweb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Locaweb&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, their Cloud Computing platform is also always evolving. They
have rolled out JeOS, Canonical’s virtualization optimized Ubuntu, so
they can offer increased performance and stability for the Linux
environment. Their platform supports both Windows and Linux options with
a large range of prices and customizations. This is the best options for
projects that are beyond web shared hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locaweb are the &lt;em&gt;exclusive sponsors&lt;/em&gt; of all the Free Online Ruby
Programming Courses (FORPC101) at RubyLearning. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref-1536-1&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Will RubyLearning be present at the Shorty Awards Acceptance Ceremony?</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/01/27/will-rubylearning-be-present-at-the-shorty-awards-acceptance-ceremony/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2009/01/27/will-rubylearning-be-present-at-the-shorty-awards-acceptance-ceremony/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The votes have been cast and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty
Awards&lt;/a&gt; have come to an end. The official
results are in, and RubyLearning is a winner of the Shorty Award in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;education category&lt;/a&gt;.
RubyLearning represented by its nearly 7000 participants from over 140
countries are delighted and so am I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/satransparent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Winner in Education category at Shorty
Awards&#34; title=&#34;Winner in the Education category at Shorty Awards&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you unfamiliar with The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/&#34;&gt;Shorty
Awards&lt;/a&gt;, they have been given to “the best
producers of short content in 2008.” And by short content, they mean 140
characters or less. In other words, these are the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/rubylearning&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does Rubylearning get as a Shorty Award winner? Aside from &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt;,
apparently a \$1000 grant to travel to Brooklyn to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shortyawards.com/awards-ceremony/&#34;&gt;awards
ceremony&lt;/a&gt;. The award
ceremony will be streamed online, posted to YouTube, and photographed /
videotaped by various media outlets. Additionally, 3 favorite Shorty
Awards nominations or votes tweeted by RubyLearning’s followers will be
projected onto a screen behind me when I (representing RubyLearning)
appear on stage to give a 140 character acceptance speech. In addition,
RubyLearning will receive an awards plaque and a gift bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though RubyLearning won, it only received 275 official votes, and I (for
RubyLearning) shamelessly asked my 1000 or so Twitter followers and 7000
RubyLearning participants to vote for me on several occasions. Only 3.4%
of my own followers thought RubyLearning deserved to win or made the
effort to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McAWilliams in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://verba.mcawilliams.com/archive/the-shorty-awards-final.html&#34;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
says that “*I think the idea of the awards themselves is an excellent
idea but the system has a few flaws*“. I agree. He mentions these flaws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The voting system should not be based on just being a popularity
contest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly people nominate tweeters in what ever category they feel
they should be in – Rubylearning was also nominated in “humor”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea of pre-populated tweets where you can provide a simple url
that brings you to your twitter webpage and has a tweet pre-filled
for you, is wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So will RubyLearning be present at the Shorty Awards Acceptance
Ceremony?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have loved to be there but some of the reasons I won’t, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The \$1000 grant to travel to Brooklyn, New York does not cover my
US\$ 1750 (roughly) cost of traveling to New York from Pune, India
where I reside. Shorty Awards probably did not realize that someone
from outside of USA could win in one of their 26 official
categories! &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards wrote back saying that “*some
winners from Russia and Australia are attending the award
ceremony*“. I wonder who these twitterers are?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorty Awards gave the winners only 14 days to make their travel
arrangements. The time is too short for international winners, like
me. All the tickets from Mumbai to New York on most airlines are
already booked. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards wrote back saying that
“&lt;em&gt;this is the award’s first year, and there are bound to be hiccups.
We’ll take this situation into account for next year, and try to
give winners more time to make travel arrangements to the
ceremony&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lighter vein, it’s freezing out there in New York. Pune is a
comfortable 86^o^ F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Shorty Awards should seriously consider is that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it’s giving out \$1,000 travel grants so that winners (the actual
people Twittering) can attend the event, so it can only be used by
winners who actually attend. (Not by proxies or winners who don’t
attend). &lt;strong&gt;This is incorrect. All award ceremonies allow proxies to
collect an award for a winner, in case the winner can’t attend – why
not at Shorty Awards? Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Shorty Awards clarified that “*the
\$1000 is not an ‘award’, it is a ‘travel grant’, and therefore can
only be claimed by winners traveling to the ceremony.*“&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a winner can’t be present at the awards ceremony, Shorty Awards
should courier the winners’ awards plaque and gift bag. &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:
Shorty Awards clarified that “&lt;em&gt;they would mail the award plaque if a
winner could not make it to the awards ceremony&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shortyawards.com/category/education&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/shorty.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shorty
Awards&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, RubyLearning’s follower count increased dramatically
and many of these people have started to converse with me regularly and
I know will become good net friends! So many new ideas got discussed and
all of this is good for &lt;strong&gt;Ruby&lt;/strong&gt;. Even at this late stage, some of my
RubyLearning participants want to start a donation drive to collect
funds so that I can travel to New York – very sweet of them. Friends,
why collect and waste money on my trip to New York. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/415&#34;&gt;do
donate and collect money for
RubyLearning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so that I can
continue maintaining the RubyLearning sites and provide quality content
to you. Game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thank you all so much for voting for RubyLearning. Almost all of
your 140 character ballots expressing why RubyLearning deserved to win
the award were terrific. Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@DrGreene: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because he makes learning programming fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@TinaShang: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because…Knowledge is power and he is giving it away
free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@hectorsq: I vote for @RubyLearning in category #education because
it really helps to spread Ruby all around the world,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@mjuneja: I vote for @RubyLearning in category #education because
it makes Ruby learning fun &amp;amp; easy &amp;amp; makes famous Rubyists
accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@Melindhra: I vote for @RubyLearning in the Shorty Awards Finals for
#education because it’s the best online learning community I’ve
seen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Speech&lt;/strong&gt;: RubyLearning sent a video of its acceptance
speech to Shorty Awards for the 11th Feb. award ceremony in New York.
(Unfortunately, no longer available.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RubyLearning&#39;s Sponsor Locaweb on a High!</title>
      <link>http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/11/07/rubylearnings-sponsor-locaweb-on-a-high/</link>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    It&amp;#8217;s time to thank RubyLearning&amp;#8217;s excellent sponsor &amp;#8211; Locaweb.&lt;sup class=&#39;footnote&#39;&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;#fn-832-1&#39; id=&#39;fnref-832-1&#39;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Locaweb delivers Rails Summit Latin America 2008
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
  The biggest news of October is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/portal.html&#34;&gt;Locaweb&lt;/a&gt; was able to deliver &lt;strong&gt;Rails Summit Latin America 2008&lt;/strong&gt;, the largest and the best Rails conference ever in Latin America. They had over 500 attendees, more than 20 speakers, several well known names such as Chad Fowler, Obie Fernandez, the Phusion guys, Dr. Nic, Jay Fields and more&lt;sup class=&#39;footnote&#39;&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;#fn-832-2&#39; id=&#39;fnref-832-2&#39;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://rubylearning.com/images/rlsummit.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marcos Ricardo and Willian Molinari at the summit&#34; title=&#34;Marcos Ricardo and Willian Molinari at the summit&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Check out the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/locaweb/sets/72157608272900991/&#34;&gt;Flickr album of the event&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    As a first in Brazilian tech events, Locaweb offered widespread free wireless internet access as well as power plug outlets throughout the facility. This allowed a higher level of interaction between the attendees. One interesting thing that happened is that a new &amp;#8220;open source&amp;#8221; project was born during this event, called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/railssummit/morena_opensource/tree/master&#34;&gt;morena_opensource&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; which means something like &amp;#8220;open source brunette&amp;#8221;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Locaweb employed several beautiful women to help out during the event and one of them, a young beautiful brunette, became the center of all attention&lt;/em&gt;. And as there were ubiquitous internet access, a new Github project was born, with several forks and lots of photos of her being uploaded at once. It was very interesting having one of the creators of Github, Chris Wanstrath himself witness this all happening. Take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=6j24jV5SGZU&#34;&gt;Dr. Nic speaking about it&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    They had real time English to Portuguese and English to Spanish translators so everybody could follow. They had real time presentations from DHH himself as well as Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo directly through a dedicated high speed internet connection. This event surpassed all expectations in many ways. First, it became clear that the Latin America Rails communities are very strong and growing. And the event itself surpassed all excellence standards in many ways. It became something more like a celebration than a traditional passive conference.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=yazXAO_deAk&#34;&gt;ending of the event&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Locaweb thanks everybody who contributed and attended. It was a great party!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    It&amp;#8217;s time to thank RubyLearning&amp;#8217;s excellent sponsor &amp;#8211; Locaweb.&lt;sup class=&#39;footnote&#39;&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;#fn-360-1&#39; id=&#39;fnref-360-1&#39;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Locaweb is Growing real Fast!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/portal.html&#34;&gt;Locaweb&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest web hosting company in Brazil and is heading to become the largest in South America by a big margin. They are about to release their brand new Cloud Computing platform, from an investment of around &lt;abbr title=&#34;USA Dollar&#34;&gt;USD&lt;/abbr&gt; 1.5 million. This should help to lower the barrier of entry for any business &amp;#8211; small and large &amp;#8211; in need for more than shared hosting space. Your business will be managed in a very dynamic environment ensuring high availability, performance and low costs.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Growing at a rate of 40% a year, Locaweb also announced the acquisition of a new Data Center. It has 28 square meters and a capacity to have 100 thousand servers. Operations in the new Data Center will begin in 2009 and the old Data Center will become a backup center to further ensure high availability.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    And the company is heavily investing in new and innovative technologies. Last month they released the official support for Ruby on Rails in all their Linux based shared hosting plans. Not only that, they further improved the support for PHP and also Python with WSGI based frameworks such as Django and Pylons.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Next month South America will have its first big Ruby on Rails event, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/railssummit-en&#34;&gt;Rails Summit Latin America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which will happen on October 15th to 16th in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Locaweb invites everybody to participate, help promote it and make Rails really viable in the South American market. Several international well known Railers such as &lt;strong&gt;Chad Fowler, Charles Nutter, Obie Fernandez&lt;/strong&gt; and others will be here to celebrate Ruby and Rails.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;alert&#34;&gt;
    As a side note, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.akitaonrails.com/&#34;&gt;Fabio Akita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Locaweb&amp;#8217;s Linux Product Manager, released a small open source project called &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/akitaonrails/locarails/tree/master&#34;&gt;Locarails&lt;/a&gt;, a command line tool that leverages Capistrano to amateur programmers. Capistrano is a well known deployment automation tool written in Ruby by Jamis Buck, from the Rails Core Team. Locarails helps you to easily configure Capistrano for your projects, ensuring trivial deployment from the developer&amp;#8217;s local workstation to Locaweb&amp;#8217;s remote hosting account, just a &amp;#8216;cap deploy&amp;#8217; away.
  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thanks to RubyLearning Sponsor Locaweb</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    It&amp;#8217;s time to thank RubyLearning&amp;#8217;s excellent sponsors!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/portal.asp?utm_campaign=Rails&amp;utm_source=rubylearning&amp;utm_medium=banner&#34;&gt;Locaweb&lt;/a&gt; is the number 1 hosting company in Brazil, with around 400 employees and 133 thousand clients, hosting more than 220 thousand domains. I am including any news or developments the sponsor has had during July 2008.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Locaweb just opened up the registration website for the greatest Ruby on Rails event in Latin America: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/railssummit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rails Summit Latin America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is only in Brazilian Portuguese right now, but in the next few days they&amp;#8217;ll release the international version so every other member of the Latin America community can register. Keep an eye on Fabio Akita&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.akitaonrails.com/english&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Rails already has 2 great events, the US and EU RailsConfs. This event is going to be a milestone for the whole community, completing the roster of big world wide Rails events. &lt;strong&gt;David Heinemeir Hansson&lt;/strong&gt; himself will speak through online video &amp;#8211; because he will be in Europe at the time &amp;#8211; but several other international speakers will be there, live, including Chad Fowler, Charles Nutter, Chris Wanstrath, Luis Lavena, Obie Fernandez, and others completing the 14 outstanding names.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    There will also be 7 great Brazilian Rails Entrepreneurs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogblogs.com.br/&#34;&gt;Manoel Lemos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.improveit.com/&#34;&gt;Vinicius Teles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://fabiokung.com/&#34;&gt;Fabio Kung&lt;/a&gt; and several others to share their experience, tips and techniques with the audience.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    They expect to have around 650 attendees. The event will take place on &lt;strong&gt;October 15th and 16th&lt;/strong&gt; being 2 full days, with 2 parallel sessions in the afternoon, including a &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Birds of a Feather&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; session at the end of the first day, allowing anyone from the community to present whatever they want and socialize.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If this event succeeds, this is going to become an annual event for the whole Latin America community. This event if for you, Railers, beginners or seniors, Ruby or non-Ruby programmers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.locaweb.com.br/railssummit/&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Register Now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and let&amp;#8217;s celebrate together!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
