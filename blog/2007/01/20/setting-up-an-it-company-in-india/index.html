            <p>Now-a-days many small (20-40 people) sized companies working with <strong>Ruby
on Rails</strong> in the US and Australia are planning to set-up their own
software units in Pune, India.</p>

<p><img src="http://rubylearning.com/images/mulshi.jpg" alt="Serene
Pune" title="Serene Pune, India" />
</p>

<p>I have been helping some of these and I have penned down some of my
experiences.</p>

<p><em>I am assuming that the foreign company has already worked out and
finalized their budgets and that they do not have a local presence.</em></p>

<p>Here are the steps involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, appoint a local consultant (LC) experienced in the entire
process. Then make sure he has some business cards. This is
essential as that person knows the local terrain and the rules and
regulations of the city where the software unit is planned to be
set-up.</li>
<li>There are many parallel activities that one needs to do. Today,
let’s start talking about one of them, namely the process of
incorporating the local company (normally a private limited
company).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A foreign company planning to set up business operations in India can
do so as under:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a foreign company through a Liaison Office / Representative
Office, Project Office or a Branch Office</li>
<li>As an Indian company through a Joint Venture or a Wholly Owned
Subsidiary</li>
<li>Foreign Company is one that has been incorporated outside India
and conducts business in India. These companies are required to
comply with the provisions of Companies Act, 1956</li>
</ul>

<p>For more details, refer the <a href="http://www.nasscom.in/Nasscom/templates/NormalPage.aspx?id=6216">Nasscom
site</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amongst the various ways of achieving the objective of setting up an IT
company in India, I am suggesting one possible way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Through your LC, appoint a local CPA (CA as they are known here).</li>
<li>To register a private company, you need a minimum of two resident
Indians as Directors. If you know the LC well or have enough trust
in him/her, appoint the LC as one of the Indian Directors.</li>
<li>The proposed Directors must have their DIN and DSC. This is in line
with mandatory e-filing of all documents with the office of
Registrar of Companies (ROC). The <a href="http://www.mca.gov.in/">Ministry of Company Affairs’
site</a> gives the full details. All the
intending Directors have to obtain the Director Identification
Number (DIN). The CPA can get a provisional DIN for you on the net
within 10 minutes. Having done so, the CPA will save the provisional
DIN form as a .pdf file, download it and then print the same. On the
first page of the printed form, a photograph is to be affixed at the
place provided and the proposed Director has to sign at two places,
i.e. one below the photograph and the other at the bottom of the
next page. Next, the CPA will take a photo-copy of the proposed
Director’s proof of identity and proof of residence and send the
printed form with the attached photo-copies to the Central DIN
Processing Cell at NOIDA. The proposed Director will normally get
the DIN approval letter within 15 days.<strong>(*)</strong></li>
<li>The Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for use of Digital
Signatures on the documents submitted in electronic form in order to
ensure the security and authenticity of the documents filed
electronically. This is the only secure and authentic way that a
document can be submitted electronically. As such, all filings done
by the companies under MCA21 e-Governance programme are required to
be filed with the use of Digital Signatures by the person authorized
to sign the documents. For this purpose a Digital Signature
Certificate (DSC) is required. This process again could take between
10-15 days. The approximate cost for DIN and DSC is Rs 3500-00 (Use
<a href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/">currency converter</a>, if required). The DSC
is normally valid for 2 years.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It is very likely that one of the foreign national (FN) in the parent
company would like to become a Director in the local private company.
The FN also needs to get his DIN approved as per the process described
above.</p>

<p><strong>(*)</strong> The FN needs to take out photo-copies of his/her passport for
proof of residence, get those photo-copies notarized in the USA and
then a certification of those notarized copies is to be obtained from
the official of the Indian Embassy in the USA. It’s advisable that the
FN send all the necessary documents along with the notarized and
certified documents to the CPA, who in turn can submit to the Central
DIN Processing Cell at NOIDA.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The next step is getting the name of the proposed company approved
from the office of ROC, which I will discuss in one of my next blog
posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>What has been your experience? Do you find the process very cumbersome
and time consuming? Are there any suggestions?</p>
