project. Although Ruby on Rails is relatively new on the scene, it
is based on technologies and approaches that ThoughtWorks has used
effectively with clients for many years. Our deep experience with
custom software development gives us an accurate picture of when and
where Ruby is a good fit and when it is not. Our ongoing project
work with Ruby and Rails proves that Ruby excels in the following
applications: Web 2.0 applications that make use of REST and/or AJAX
designs; Small to medium web-based applications with aggressive
time-to-market goals; Low-cost internal prototypes and pilot
applications; Highly-targeted internal applications and utility
programs; So-called “soft layer” APIs on hardened transactional
systems; Build systems for complex enterprise systems. Ruby’s
productivity can also result in early hi-fi prototypes that quickly
allows for the exploration of new ideas. ThoughtWorks Pune also
hosted the Ruby Fun Day, to have fun playing around with Ruby
technology and Ruby On Rails. It was a great way to meet fellow Ruby
enthusiasts and discuss new innovations in the Ruby world. The URL
of that event is at
